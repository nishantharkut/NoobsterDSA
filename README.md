# 🚀 NoobsterDSA

**Track your DSA & CP progress with ease, clarity, and motivation.**  
A productivity-focused web app designed to help beginners in Data Structures & Algorithms and Competitive Programming log their daily practice, contest performance, and weekly goals—because consistency beats intensity.

## 📌 Project Description

Every DSA beginner struggles with scattered resources—Striver’s A2Z, TLE Eliminator, NeetCode, and many more—making it hard to track progress in one place.  
That’s why I built **NoobsterDSA**: a centralized logging and analytics platform tailored for the CP community to monitor:

- ✅ Daily Practice Logs
- 🧠 Contest Performances
- 🎯 Weekly Goals & Reflections

All with rich metadata support, auto-tagging, smart summaries, and a clean, gamified UI.
