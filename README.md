## Project Description

Every DSA beginner struggles with scattered resources‚ÄîStriver‚Äôs A2Z, TLE Eliminator, NeetCode, and many more‚Äîmaking it hard to track progress in one place.  
That‚Äôs why I built **NoobsterDSA**: a centralized logging and analytics platform tailored for the CP community to monitor:

- Daily Practice Logs
- Contest Performances
- Weekly Goals & Reflections

All with rich metadata support, auto-tagging, smart summaries, and a clean, gamified UI.
